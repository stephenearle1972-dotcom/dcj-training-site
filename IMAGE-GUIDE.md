## 💡 Tips

1. **Use lowercase letters** - Better for web compatibility
2. **Use hyphens (-)** not spaces - Spaces cause problems in URLs
3. **Keep .jpg extension** - Works on all browsers
4. **Optimize before upload** - Use tinypng.com to reduce file size

## ⚠️ Important

If you forget to rename the files or name them differently:
- The website will show broken image icons
- You'll need to either:
  1. Rename the files correctly, OR
  2. Edit the HTML to match your file names

The correct names are already in the website code, so renaming your files is the easiest option!
